# Research Motivation

Many individuals experience emotional distress patterns that are not
random but structured over time. I am interested in modeling these
patterns computationally to support early detection of mental overload.

# Core Question

Can temporal emotion patterns be modeled as latent states, and can
state transitions predict psychological risk?

# Approach (Planned)

- Emotion logging as time-series data
- Pattern clustering (latent states)
- Transition analysis between emotional states
- Risk score based on instability and accumulation

# Long-term Goal

This project is a foundational step toward AI-assisted mental distress
prediction and intervention support systems.
